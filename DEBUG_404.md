# 🚨 404 Error Debugging Guide

## 🔍 **Current Issue Analysis**

You're still getting a 404 error even after the routing fix. This suggests one of several possible issues:

## 🎯 **Possible Causes:**

### **1. Server Not Redeployed**
The most likely cause is that your **Render server hasn't been redeployed** with the new routing changes.

### **2. Environment Variable Issue**
Your `VITE_API_BASE_URL` might not be set correctly in Vercel.

### **3. Caching Issues**
Browser or CDN caching might be serving old versions.

## 🧪 **Debugging Steps:**

### **Step 1: Test Backend Directly**
Test if your backend is working by visiting these URLs in your browser:

```bash
# Test basic server
https://evangadi-forum-7n4z.onrender.com/

# Test auth routes (new debug endpoint)
https://evangadi-forum-7n4z.onrender.com/api/auth/test

# Test forgot password endpoint directly
curl -X POST https://evangadi-forum-7n4z.onrender.com/api/auth/forgot-password \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com"}'
```

### **Step 2: Check Environment Variables**

**In Vercel Dashboard:**
1. Go to your project settings
2. Check "Environment Variables"
3. Verify `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is set to: `https://evangadi-forum-7n4z.onrender.com`

**In Render Dashboard:**
1. Go to your service
2. Check "Environment" tab
3. Verify `CLIENT_URL` is set to: `https://evangadi-forum-theta.vercel.app`

### **Step 3: Force Redeploy**

**Render (Backend):**
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"
3. Wait for deployment to complete

**Vercel (Frontend):**
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Click "Redeploy" on your latest deployment
3. Wait for deployment to complete

## 🔧 **Quick Fixes Applied:**

I've added debugging features to help identify the issue:

1. **Debug endpoint**: `/api/auth/test` - Test if auth routes are working
2. **Console logging**: Added logs to the forgot password controller
3. **Better error handling**: Enhanced error messages

## 🚀 **Immediate Action Required:**

1. **Redeploy your Render backend** with the latest changes
2. **Redeploy your Vercel frontend** 
3. **Test the debug endpoint**: `https://evangadi-forum-7n4z.onrender.com/api/auth/test`

## 📊 **Expected Results:**

After redeployment:
- Debug endpoint should return: `{"message": "Auth routes are working!", "timestamp": "..."}`
- Forgot password should work without 404 errors
- Console should show: `🔍 Forgot password endpoint hit: {email: "..."}`

## 🚨 **If Still Not Working:**

If you still get 404 errors after redeployment:

1. **Check Render logs** for any startup errors
2. **Verify the exact URL** being called in browser dev tools
3. **Test with curl** to bypass browser caching
4. **Check if environment variables** are properly set

The most common cause is that the server hasn't been redeployed with the new routing changes!
